I'm currently a PhD candidate at [CERDI](https://cerdi.uca.fr/) and a consultant in Macroeconomics, Trade, and Investment Global Practice at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). 
I'm an economist dedicated to addressing development challenges through innovative approaches. My focus lies in harnessing the power of emerging technologies, particularly remote sensing data, geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and A.I. models, to enhance knowledge and facilitate data-driven policymaking. With a robust background spanning various facets of development economics, I have cultivated expertise in a diverse array of topics. From microeconomic issues like health or rural electrification to macroeconomic themes such as development finance, trade dynamics, energy access, and vulnerability analysis, I've delved into multifaceted dimensions of development.
